# snek

### A small game written in Haskell

## Idea
The idea for the application is primarily to do an exercise in Haskell. I have become familiar with the language by doing small code problems, but it is now time to create an actual application. 

I went with *snek*, because I am familiar with the problem domain, I've written a game like this before, but in Java. It also consist of a bit of IO.

Furthermore, it is an exercise in *Event Sourcing*, which I think functional programming might be an exelent choice for. It will also involve developing some simple AI, and see if I can make them play eachother.

The unit tests will be written in TDD, as I always so, and if I can figure out how to make integration tests, they will as well.

## Architecure
The game will have the following elements: (an ever changing list, but I thought it might be fun to see how it changes over time)
